REQUIREMENTS:
- A legally obtained ROM of Super Smash Brothers for N64.

STEPS:
- use xdelta to apply the patch to your ROM.

WHAT IS THIS?:
- This skin mod replaces Fox's skin with Berdly from Toby Fox's game, DELTARUNE.
- The meme version includes the skin mod and also changes things about Fox's moveset. Making him over-powered.
- Berdly does not use guns so I gave him potassium as a compromise
- His shine is also replaced with a neat graphic!

I included the bmps in case anyone wanted to edit them. If someone sends me a better graphic, I can update the repository + model and give credit.
